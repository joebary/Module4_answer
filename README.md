In this Challenge, I'll assume the role of a quantitative analyst for a FinTech investing platform. This platform aims to offer clients a one-stop online investment solution for their retirement portfolios thatâ€™s both inexpensive and high quality.

New investment options for inclusion in the client portfolios. Legendary fund and hedge-fund managers run all four selections. (People sometimes refer to these managers as whales because of the large amount of money that they manage). I will need to determine the fund with the most investment potential based on key risk-management metrics: the daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios, and betas.
